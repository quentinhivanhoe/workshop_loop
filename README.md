# Advanced loops for the noobs

today we are going to see advanced loops for people who can't use them. We are going to implement some functions for parsing. There is three levels of loops:
- **Easy** loops that need only one loop
- **Medium** loops complex and need more undesrtanding of loop
- **Dificult** very difficult loops who need one ore more loops

For each functions malloc are other functions van be used, of course **C standard library functions can't be used**

> after you success each function you can use them on your library

You can find easy function on the _Easy_ folder, same for other difficulties levels.
